In this project, a smart glove human-machine interface integrated with contact-separation TENGs was proposed to realize the hand gesture recognition and control of 3D objects in AR environment. The designed TENGs can monitor the bending and the movements of fingers and generate signals. After the signal acquisition and processing module, convolutional neural network (CNN) was proposed to extract features and realize hand gesture recognition based on the TENGs generated signals. Next, three simple AR scenes were established. The recognition results were transmitted by TCP/IP from deep learning model to AR environment and then achieved the control of 3D objects in real time.
