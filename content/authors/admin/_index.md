Iï»¿ am a second-year PhD student at Tongji University with a focus on visualization. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor [Nan Cao ](http://nancao.org/)and part of the [IDVX Lab](https://idvxlab.com/)

My research interests include data visualization, human-computer interaction. I aim to develop intelligent systems to assist users in generating visual content, while augmenting human-AI collaboration. Before now, I received her MSc degree in Electrical & Computer Engineering from National University of Singapore in 2021.
