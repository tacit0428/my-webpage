In this project, path tracking control strategies are reviewed in terms of the kinematic and dynamic vehicle models used. LQR, MPC, and differentiable MPC methods are introduced in detail and realized in CARLA simulator to test the path tracking problem's performance. We show that the differentiable MPC, an end-to-end learning method, can also be used in the autonomous driving field with its advantages. Based on the comparison, the challenges and possible research direction are analyzed.
