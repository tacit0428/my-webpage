We introduce MusicJam, a music visualization system that is able to generate narrative illustrations to represent the insight of the input music. The system leverages a novel generation model designed based on GPT-2 to generate meaningful lyrics given the input music and then employs the stable diffusion model to transform the lyrics into coherent illustrations. Finally, the generated results are synchronized and rendered as an MP4 video accompanied by the input music. We evaluated the proposed lyric generation model by comparing it to the baseline models and conducted a user study to estimate the quality of the generated illustrations and the final music videos. The results showed the power of our technique.
